# chargelimit
This script is used to limit the battery charge on my Asus notebook running Ubuntu. I arrived at it after several tests and I don't know if it works properly on other devices. Feel free to test, modify, and reuse.

## Usage:
chargelimit VALUE or COMMAND

Value:

  Between 50 an 100

Commands:

  get     print the currently limit

  reload  force reload

  --help  print this command list
